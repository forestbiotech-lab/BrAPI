    p PHENO aims to provide access to plant phenotypic datasets, with a major focus on the woody plant domain.
    p Plant phenotyping is central to plant research and breeding and is becoming increasingly throughput, with large amounts of data being generated from diverse experimental settings. Access to phenotypic datasets annotated according to widely accepted standards contributes for data interoperability, enabling powerful genotype-phenotype association studies. 
    p Woody plants are a major natural resource in Europe, with a huge ecological and economic impact, supporting millions of jobs across diverse industries (e.g., wine, fruit, olive oil, coffee, paper, timber, cork) and strongly contributing to the European GDP. In Portugal, woody plants represent 10% of the exports, and are a central research domain in both academia and industry. The access to datasets provided by PHENO aims to support research and breeding of these species for traits of interest for researchers, producers and industry stakeholders.   
  p PHENO currently contains data on the following species:
